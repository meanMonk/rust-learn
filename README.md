> RUST IS CURLY BRACES LANGUAGE WITH SEMICOLONS

Rust install the below two modules along with compiler for rust.

1. rustup > helps to update the rust version as it's having frequent updates.
2. cargo > it's package manager for rust. 
 - `packages` in rust called as `crates` you can access all available rust crates at [crates](https://crates.io/)

## Visual Studio Plugins

## Intro.
--- 

Rust is system programming languages.
you can build anything low which you can build in rust.
 
 1. databases
 2. compiler
 3. low level networking 
 4. etc.
 
# Program Ideas
 ---
 
 1. **CLI PROGRAM**
   - currency converter
   - emoji generator
 2. **WebAssembly** -> low assembly language in binary format which is very fast.
   - you can use written any lang compile it webassembly.
   - rust provide the interface with webapp with webassembly.
   - can integrate into other env like (any os, browser, mobile as well)
   - **Advs**
      - Computational Intensive task
      - Games, Image processing, Maths, Physics , audio effects.
 3. **Server Side App** -> performance, scalable, networking, robust
 4. **Embedded Program** 
 5. **Game development**
 6. **Block Chain Smart Contracts**



NOTES:

> So I'd suggest you become familiar with all the iterator methods. because they are crucial to writing good Rust code without having to write loops out all the time
